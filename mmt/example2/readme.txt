nodemcu esp8266 with DHT11 sensor,,, (NO DATABASE STORAGE)

it sends DHT11 temperature and humidity data, with timestamp from ntp server to the flaskk server...
flask server receives post (incoming esp8266 data) messages,
flask server also receives get request messages (index.html site asking to flask server), site wants to have data...

flask takes data from nodemcu, processes it, and sends/responds the request msg from website, by sending this sensor data...

data is displayed, changed every 5 seconds, (as set here in .js file),
site hosted by flask server locally here for now...
